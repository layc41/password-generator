# Password Generator
This is a customizable random user password generator. It asks for length of password from 8 - 128 characters. Then asks for character types to be included in the password. Types of characters available are lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. If the amount of characters are out of range and no character types are selected, then a password cannot be generated.
